/*
 * This example illustrates the use of modules to implement roles in 2APL. 
 *
 * The aim of this multi-agent system in this example is to collect all bombs in 
 * the environment and drop them to the the waste bin, which is assumed to be 
 * at location 0,0.  
 * 
 * Multi-agent system consist of one manager and three worker agents. The 
 * manager agent is authoritatively ordering workers to enact either explorer
 * role or carrier role.
 * 
 * The roles of worker agents are implemented as modules and therefore can be 
 * instantiated and executed during runtime as illustrated in this example.
